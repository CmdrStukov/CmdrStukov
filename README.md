ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @CmdrStukov

A bit late to the party, but glad to be here.

I am interested in the design of algorithms; their linguistic and mechanical realisations.

I enjoy problem solving and listening to music (all sorts, from classical to reggae).

I am currently learning:
 - Lisp
 - C
 - Perl

Not new to programming but constantly seeking ways to push the boundaries and learn.
